Space A* simulation

Edit the layout in edit mode by selecting different options and clicking on the grid to make changes.
Pressing T randomizes the grid blocks and all entity locations.
Entities can be on top of each other, if not all entities are visible this is probably why.

Pressing space starts the simulation, and when it is done press R to go back to the editing mode.

A* logic was inspired by CodeMonkey's Unity C# scripts that were provided as course material in studium.
Chat GPT was used to help with formulating the syntax for lambda functions.
